# hospital-data-analysis
## What it is
A hospital has a large file of patient data.  They would like to know some statistics based off patient data, however it would take a person a very long time to do
this and they would be prone to error.  My job is to create a GUI which allows a user to get the (average cost per year life lived), (average cost to treat a patient),
(average number of months until death), (average age of patient at death).  This data will be saved to a file for later viewing.

## How it works
This script is created using python and the tkinter, numpy, and matplotlib libraries.  I broke it down in to a few primary functions calculateAverages(file parser),
graphing, GUI entering the initial file location, and lastly the GUI section for handling the data the user is interested.

## The Program
